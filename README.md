# OOP2_Textalyzer

## Introduction

OOP2_Textalyzer is an Android app developed as part of a university module. It allows users to write texts or upload them as a PDF file, which are then summarized or analyzed using artificial intelligence.

## Installation

As the app is still in beta stage, the APK needs to be built manually at the moment.

## Usage

The app follows a linear workflow:

1. On the main screen, the user chooses whether he wants to enter text or upload a PDF.
2. On the second screen, he can do this.
3. On the third screen, he chooses what should be done with the text.
4. On the fourth screen, he gets the answer displayed.
